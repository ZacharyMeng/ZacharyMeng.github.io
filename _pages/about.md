[NaLaFormer: Norm-Aware Linear Attention for Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21137)

**Weikang Meng**, Yadan Luo, Liangyu Huo, Yaowei Wang, Xin Li, Zheng Zhang

This work introduced a linear attention mechanism for Transformer-based models, called NaLaFormer. Based on the Positive Sequence Entropy (PSE), this work theoretically analysed the dynamic entropy reduction of softmax attention controlled by query norm and proposed the norm-aware kernel function. In addition, NaLaFormer utilized the Ptolemy's theorem to keep the non-negative constrain of the attention weight.

[PolaFormer: Polarity-aware Linear Attention for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15061)

**Weikang Meng**, Yadan Luo, Xin Li, Dongmei Jiang, Zheng Zhang

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cZOoYMkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cZOoYMkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='cZOoYMkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C'></span></strong>
This work presented a novel attention mechanism with linear complexity called PolaFormer. Our PolaFormer computed the similarity in a polarity-aware form to avoid neglecting negatives, at the same time, we theoretically proposed a familty of element-wise functions to make the attention weight more spiky and employ a learnable power function for simplicity and rescaling.
